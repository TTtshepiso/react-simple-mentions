Getting started: Quick tour
This quick tour shows how to add mentions support to a text input in a React app. It demonstrates a common pattern that you‚Äôll see in many real projects.

- Step 1: Install the package
- Step 2: Import the component
- Step 3: Create a basic mentions input
- Step 4: Bind data and handle changes
- Step 5: Style and extend

Step 1: Install
- npm install react-simple-mentions
- yarn add react-simple-mentions

Step 2: Import
- In JavaScript/TypeScript files:
  - import MentionsInput from 'react-simple-mentions';

Step 3: Basic usage
- Basic outside-the-box example for a simple mentions input component:

Code example (TypeScript-friendly)
- Note: This is a simplified example to illustrate the core usage. Adapt data shapes to your app.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import MentionsInput, { Mention } from 'react-simple-mentions';

type User = {
  id: string;
  display: string;
  avatar?: string;
};

const users: User[] = [
  { id: 'u1', display: 'Alice' },
  { id: 'u2', display: 'Bob' },
  { id: 'u3', display: 'Charlie' },
];

export function AppMentions() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<string>('');

  return (
    <MentionsInput
      value={value}
      onChange={setValue}
      placeholder="Type something and mention people with @"
      aria-label="Message with mentions"
    >
      <Mention trigger="@" data={users} displayProp="display" />
    </MentionsInput>
  );
}
```

Step 4: Data handling
- The onChange handler receives the new content whenever the user updates the text.
- You can parse and extract mentions from the text to include in your data model, comments, or notifications.
- For large lists of users, you can implement lazy loading, search, or virtualization to keep the dropdown responsive.

Step 5: Styling
- The component uses CSS-in-JS-friendly approaches or standard CSS to let you theme the input and the dropdown.
- You can pass className to the main input and to the dropdown to customize visuals.
- Theming hooks or CSS variables can help you create a consistent design system.

Installation and setup
- Quick steps to integrate in a new or existing React project:
  - Add the package to your project with npm or yarn.
  - Import the component into the page or section where you want mentions.
  - Provide your data source for suggestions and bind to state for the text value.
  - Add styling to match your app‚Äôs look and feel.
- If you are using a module bundler, ensure it supports JSX and TypeScript if you choose to write in TS.

Installation options
- npm, yarn, or pnpm are common package managers.
- If you use TypeScript, you‚Äôll gain type safety through the included types.

Usage patterns and examples
- Basic text input with mentions
- Rich text variants where mentions are embedded in content
- Multiline inputs with line breaks and mentions
- Custom suggestion rendering
- Grouped suggestions and sections
- Inline vs. block rendering of mentions

API: Props and components
This section covers the core API you‚Äôll use in most apps. The goal is to have a predictable set of props that are easy to reason about.

MentionsInput props
- value: string
  - The current content of the input. Controlled mode is common, but you can also operate in uncontrolled mode with internal state.
- onChange: (value: string) => void
  - Callback fired when the content changes. Useful to sync with form state or perform validation.
- placeholder: string
  - Placeholder text shown when the input is empty.
- trigger: string
  - Character that starts a mention (commonly "@"). Supports one or more triggers if you expose that capability.
- data: Array<User>
  - Array of items to be shown in the dropdown. The shape is customizable; you can define a display property for UI and an id for internal references.
- displayProp: string
  - Property name to display in the dropdown for each item. If omitted, a sensible default is used.
- renderMention?: (user: User) => React.ReactNode
  - Optional function to customize how a mention appears in the text. This is powerful for custom visuals, avatars, or badges.
- ariaLabel?: string
  - Accessibility label for screen readers.
- className?: string
  - Additional class for styling the input container.
- style?: React.CSSProperties
  - Inline style for quick customization.

Mention component props
- trigger: string
  - The character that starts a mention (e.g., "@").
- data: Array<User>
  - Data source for suggestions when the user opens the dropdown.
- displayProp: string
  - The property used for the item‚Äôs display text in the list.
- onSelection?: (item: User) => void
  - Callback when a user is selected from the dropdown.
- renderItem?: (item: User) => React.ReactNode
  - Custom item renderer for the dropdown.

Advanced props and patterns
- data fetching
  - You can pass a function to data that fetches suggestions from an API. Implement debouncing to avoid excessive requests.
- virtualization
  - For large data sets, consider virtualization to keep the dropdown performant.
- multi-trigger mentions
  - Support for multiple triggers like "@" and "#" to cover different mention types (user mentions, topic mentions, etc.).
- custom rendering
  - Use renderMention and renderItem to tailor the UI to your design system.

Theming and customization
- CSS variables
  - Define theme variables for input background, borders, caret color, and mention highlight. Example:
    - --mention-bg
    - --mention-highlight
    - --dropdown-bg
- Style overrides
  - Pass a className to the main container and the dropdown to override CSS or to hook into your CSS framework (Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.).
- Custom mention appearance
  - Use renderMention to add avatars, badges, or status indicators to each mention in the text.
- Responsive behavior
  - Ensure the dropdown and input resize gracefully on smaller screens. Consider layout constraints and touch targets.

Keyboard and accessibility
- Focus management
  - The input should support focus, blur, and programmatic focus when the dropdown opens.
- Keyboard navigation
  - Up/Down arrow keys navigate suggestions.
  - Enter or Tab confirms a selection.
  - Escape closes the dropdown.
- ARIA
  - The input has aria-label and aria-describedby attributes when needed.
  - The dropdown is announced with appropriate roles and live regions for screen readers.

Performance considerations
- Rendering strategy
  - The component uses efficient rendering to minimize reflows as you type.
- Debouncing input
  - Debounce fetches for remote data to reduce network traffic.
- Memory footprint
  - The internal state is kept minimal. You can rely on React to clean up unused listeners.

Testing and reliability
- Unit tests
  - Write unit tests to cover basic rendering, dropdown behavior, and selection logic.
- Accessibility tests
  - Include tests for keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- End-to-end tests
  - Validate user flows like typing, triggering a mention, selecting a suggestion, and validating the final text content.

Accessibility notes
- The component is designed to be accessible by default. It uses semantic roles and keyboard interactions that align with common accessibility patterns.
- When you customize, ensure that any added visuals maintain accessible contrast and that interactive elements remain keyboard reachable.
- If you add custom rendering for mentions, ensure that each rendered mention has an appropriate accessible name and role.

Data flow and integration with your app
- Controlled vs. uncontrolled
  - In a controlled approach, the parent component maintains the value and passes onChange to update it.
  - In an uncontrolled approach, the component can manage its own state and expose a ref for the current value if needed.
- Saving mentions
  - When you submit a form containing a mentions input, parse the content to extract mention tokens. You can maintain a separate list of mentions with IDs for backend integration.
- Data synchronization
  - If your data source changes (for example, a user list updates after a fetch), ensure the data prop updates so the dropdown reflects the latest information.

Examples and real-world scenarios
- Chat input
  - A messaging app where users can mention teammates with @. The dropdown shows teammates with avatars and online status. The input uses a multiline variant so messages can span several lines.
- Comment section
  - A blog or forum where users can mention authors or topic tags. The trigger could be "@" for people and "#" for topics.
- Collaboration tool
  - A project board or document editor where mentions create links to user profiles or tasks.

Running through an end-to-end example
- Initialization
  - You initialize the mentions input with a list of users from your API. Each user has an id and a display name.
- Typing
  - As the user types "@", the dropdown opens, listing available users. The user uses arrow keys to navigate and Enter to select.
- Insertion
  - Selecting a user inserts a nicely formatted token into the text. It remains visible as the user continues typing.
- Submission
  - On submit, you parse the content to extract mentions and save both the text and mention IDs to your server.

TypeScript usage and typings
- The library is designed to be TypeScript-friendly. You can define your own User type and supply it to the data prop.
- Example:
  - type User = { id: string; display: string; avatar?: string; }

- Props typing
  - The component accepts generic props where necessary. If you expose a renderMention function, you can customize how an individual mention is displayed.

- Data shape considerations
  - If your app uses a nested user object, you can map your data to the expected shape with a small adapter function.
  - If your app needs nested groups (e.g., teams), you can extend the data prop to include a group field and group the dropdown items accordingly.

Examples gallery and live demos
- Live demos are a great way to explore the component‚Äôs capabilities. You can host demos on platforms like CodeSandbox, StackBlitz, or a dedicated demo page within your site.
- Include several examples:
  - Basic text input with @ mentions
  - Multiple triggers with different styling
  - Mention with avatars in the dropdown
  - Rich content in the rendered mentions
  - A long list of users with virtualization

Advanced patterns and customization
- Custom suggestion filtering
  - Implement a search function that takes the user‚Äôs query and returns a filtered list. Debounce the input to minimize unnecessary work.
- Grouped suggestions
  - Group users by department or role. The dropdown displays group headers.
- Emoji support
  - If you want to include emoji in your suggestions, you can render them in the display or as part of the custom item renderer.
- Theming hooks
  - Use theme provider wrappers to switch between light and dark modes without altering component logic.

TypeScript: practical type examples
- Demonstration of a strongly typed usage pattern with a typed data source.

```ts
type User = {
  id: string;
  display: string;
  avatarUrl?: string;
  role?: string;
};

type Props = {
  value: string;
  onChange: (value: string) => void;
  users: User[];
};

function MentionsExample({ value, onChange, users }: Props) {
  return (
    <MentionsInput value={value} onChange={onChange} placeholder="Mention someone with @">
      <Mention trigger="@" data={users} displayProp="display" renderMention={(u) => (
        <span className="mention" key={u.id}>
          {u.display}
        </span>
      )} />
    </MentionsInput>
  );
}
```

- A more complex example showing a two-trigger setup (@ for users, # for topics):

```tsx
type User = { id: string; display: string };
type Topic = { id: string; label: string };

const users: User[] = [
  { id: 'u1', display: 'Alice' },
  { id: 'u2', display: 'Bob' },
];

const topics: Topic[] = [
  { id: 't1', label: 'Design' },
  { id: 't2', label: 'Engineering' },
];

export function DualMentions() {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');
  return (
    <div>
      <MentionsInput value={value} onChange={setValue} placeholder="Mention people @ or topics #">
        <Mention trigger="@" data={users} displayProp="display" />
        <Mention trigger="#" data={topics} displayProp="label" />
      </MentionsInput>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- Data fetching example with remote data
  - You can fetch suggestions from an API and supply them to the data prop. Debounce requests to avoid excessive calls.

```ts
function useUsersQuery(query: string) {
  // Debounced fetch from your API
  // Return a list of users
  // This is a conceptual example
}
```

- Accessibility example with ARIA
  - Ensure appropriate labeling and roles for screen readers.

Theming and design system alignment
- You can align with a design system by:
  - Providing tokens for colors, border radii, typography, and shadows.
  - Using CSS variables or a theme provider to switch themes at runtime.
  - Exposing a simple API to override class names and inline styles.
